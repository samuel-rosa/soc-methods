## Highlights

* We present pedotransfer functions to harmonize soil carbon/organic matter data
* Including the intercept and quadratic terms improves prediction performance
* Sampling depth, clay content, and soil type are also good predictor variables
* A weighted least-squares approach produces realistic estimates of uncertainty
* A free computer application is available to employ the pedotransfer functions

## Abstract

A variety of analytical methods can be used to measure soil carbon and organic matter content and their results are not equivalent. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to convert results between analytical methods in southern Brazil. Some 105 soil samples were employed, covering various land uses, soil classes, sampling depths, and clay contents, sampled throughout the State of Rio Grande do Sul. Four analytical methods were considered: carbon content by dry combustion (TOC) and wet digestion (OC), and organic matter content by wet digestion (OM) and loss on ignition (TOM). Seven formulations are tested for each PTF, each including a different set of predictor variables, plus a predictor analytical method, starting with those that are easier to obtain: A) no intercept, B) intercept, C) B + quadratic term, D) C + soil depth, E) D + land use, F) E + clay content, and G) F + soil class. Regression model coefficients were estimated using weighted least squares to account for the non-constant error variance. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to compute prediction performance measures: median error (MedE), median absolute error (MedAE), median squared error (MedSE), median squared deviation ratio (MedSDR), amount of variation explained (AVE), and modified amount of variation explained (mAVE). Overall, the prediction performance of PTFs was considerably improved by including the intercept and quadratic terms, and data on sampling depth, clay content, and soil type. For instance, when TOM was modeled as a function of OM, TOM ~ OM, a four-fold reduction in prediction bias was obtained, from 8 g kg<sup>-1</sup> to 2 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, by increasing the number of predictors. The best performances were obtained when OC or TOC was the dependent or the predictor variable. In the case of OC ~ TOC and TOC ~ OC, about 90% of the variation in the data was explained (mAVE = 0.90). But for OM ~ TOM and TOM ~ OM, the mAVE was only 0.75. All PTFs, irrespective of the formulation, overestimate the prediction error variance (MedSDR < 0.455), which means that they estimate prediction intervals that are too wide. Future studies should consider using more samples containing higher carbon / organic matter content to more uniformly cover the feature space. This is necessary to reduce the uncertainty of estimated model coefficients and thus produce reliable estimates of prediction intervals.<br>
